This package has been excluded from the GitHub pages as if I allow public access to the methods of
Authentication and allow for public access, auth tokens could be decrypted and the integrity
of the plugin would be lost. This would be catasrophic as the AuthTokens
have the ability to grant ranks to players. For a similar reason, all Testing solutions packages have been excluded from the Github page.
